# General Assembly Python course - final project

This is my final project for the General Assembly Python course I have attended (November 2019 - March 2020).

My goal for this project was to tackle a problem that incorporates web scraping and data analysis using Python and relevant Python libraries.

The final product will be a web scraper than can be deployed on websites to extract store location data (addresses, coordinates, store name etc.) of retailers. This data will then go through a number of cleaning and processing methods, resulting in a clean and structured .csv file which can be geocoded into GIS software.
