# General Assembly Python course - final project

This is my final project for the General Assembly Python course I have attended (November 2019 - March 2020).

My goal for this project was to tackle a problem that incorporates web scraping and data analysis using Python and relevant Python libraries.

The final product will be a web scraper than can be deployed on websites to extract store location data (store names and addresses) of retailers. This data will then be processed and cleaned up, resulting in a structured .csv file containing all of a retailers stores across Australia. 

This final output .csv can then be geocoded into GIS mapping software for analysis.
