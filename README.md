# ga_python_project

This is my final project for the General Assembly python course I have attended.

My goal for this project was to tackle a problem that incorporates web scraping and data analysis using python and relevant python libraries.

The final product will be a web scraper than can be deployed to scrape websites for store location data (addresses, coordinates, store name etc.), 
process this information and finish with a clean and structured .csv file which can be geocoded into GIS software.
